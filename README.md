# Food-App-Landing-Page
This app was created by me using the "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" course from Udemy. 
It is a landing page for a food app with a starter/upbeat feel which contains many UI and styling concepts like a hero component, a Z-pattern, pricing, a sticky nav, but also core CSS and HTML concepts like flexbox, CSS grid and modern HTML5 tags.
